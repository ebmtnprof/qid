\title{Compares a baseline "intercepts only" model to one including the system variable for predicting the dynamic parameters of the inertia coordination model.}
\usage{
inertCoordSysVarIn(basedata, sysVarType, dist0name, dist1name)
}
\arguments{
\item{basedata}{A dataframe containing the inertia-coordination parameter estimates produced by the "indivInertCoord" function.}

\item{sysVarType}{Whether the system variable is "dyad", which means both partners have the same socre, or "indiv" which means the partners can have different scores}

\item{dist0name}{A name for the level-0 of the distinguishing variable (e.g., "Women").}

\item{dist1name}{A name for the level-1 of the distinguishing variable (e.g., "Men").}
}
\value{
The function returns a list including: 1) the gls objects containing the full results for each model (called "models"), and 2) adjusted R^2 information for each model (called "R2").
}
\description{
Multivariate correlated residuals dyadic models are used to predict the set of inertia-coordination parameters (inert0, inert1, coord0, coord1) from the system variable. The system variable can be either dyadic (sysVarType = "dyad"), where both partners have the same score (e.g., relationship length) or individual (sysVarType = "indiv"), where the partners can have different scores (e.g., age). If it is individual then both actor and partner effects of the system variable are included and are indicated by a_ and p_ preceding the variable names.
