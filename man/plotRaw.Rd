\title{Plots of observed variable over time by dyad.}
\usage{
plotRaw(basedata, dyad, obs, dist, time_name, dist0name, dist1name)
}
\arguments{
\item{basedata}{A dataframe.}

\item{dyad}{The name of the column in the dataframe that has the dyad-level identifier.}

\item{obs}{The name of the column in the dataframe that has the time-varying observable (e.g., the variable for which dynamics will be assessed).}

\item{dist}{The name of the column in the dataframe that has a variable that distinguishes the partners (e.g., sex, mother/daughter, etc) that is numeric and scored 0/1.}

\item{time_name}{The name of the column in the dataframe that indicates sequential temporal observations.}

\item{dist0name}{A name for the level-0 of the distinguishing variable (e.g., "Women").}

\item{dist1name}{A name for the level-1 of the distinguishing variable (e.g., "Men").}
}
\description{
Produces plots of the observed variable for each dyad over time to check for data errors, etc.
